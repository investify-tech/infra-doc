# Network Architecture

Our network infrastructure follows a three-tier architecture model optimized for scalability and security.

## Core Components

- **Load Balancers**: Distribute traffic across multiple instances
- **Firewalls**: Network security and access control
- **Switches**: Layer 2 connectivity within VLANs
- **Routers**: Inter-network routing and WAN connectivity

## Security Zones

1. **DMZ**: Public-facing services
2. **Internal**: Core business applications
3. **Management**: Administrative access only

## Key Metrics

- Bandwidth: 10 Gbps backbone
- Latency: <5ms internal
- Availability: 99.9% SLA
